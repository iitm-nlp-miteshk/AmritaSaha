This dataset contains a series of linked QA pairs forming a coherent conversation. Further, these questions are answerable from a Knowledge Graph using logical, comparative and/or quantitative reasoning. We attempt to do so by collecting templates from in-house annotators, which are then used to link individual QA pairs to form a coherent dialog. This process is used to instantiate around 200K dialogs containing 1.6 million linked QA pairs.
